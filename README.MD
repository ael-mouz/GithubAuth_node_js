# Express.js GitHub Authentication Project

## Project Overview
This project is an example implementation of GitHub authentication using Express.js. It demonstrates how to authenticate users with GitHub, retrieve user data, and store it in a session.

## Project Structure
The project follows the following directory structure:

- `controllers/`: Contains controller modules for handling different routes and authentication logic.
- `routes/`: Contains route modules defining the project's routes and their corresponding controllers.
- `views/`: Contains EJS view templates for rendering the HTML pages.
- `index.js`: The main entry point of the application, where the Express server is configured and started.

## Dependencies
The project uses the following dependencies:

- `express`: A fast and minimalist web framework for Node.js.
- `express-session`: Middleware for managing user sessions in Express.
- `dotenv`: Loads environment variables from a `.env` file.
- `axios`: A promise-based HTTP client for making requests to external APIs.
- `nodemon`: A development tool that automatically restarts the Node.js server when changes are detected.
- `ejs`: A simple templating language for generating HTML markup with JavaScript.

## Getting Started
To set up and run the project, follow these steps:

1. Clone the project repository from GitHub.
2. Navigate to the project directory.
3. Install the project dependencies by running `npm install`.
4. Create a `.env` file in the project root directory and configure the following variables:
   - `SESSION_SECRET`: Secret key for session encryption.
   - `CLIENT_ID`: Your GitHub OAuth client ID.
   - `CLIENT_SECRET`: Your GitHub OAuth client secret.
   - `CALLBACK_URL`: The URL to handle the GitHub authentication callback.
5. Start the application by running `npx nodemon index.js` or `npm start`.
6. Access the application in your browser at `http://localhost:3000`.

## Usage
Once the application is running, you can perform the following actions:

- Visit the home page to see the index view.
- Click the "Login with GitHub" button to initiate the GitHub authentication flow.
- After successful authentication, you will be redirected to the success page, displaying your GitHub user data.
- Click the "Logout" link to destroy the session and return to the home page.

## Conclusion
This project demonstrates how to implement GitHub authentication in an Express.js application. It provides a foundation for building more advanced authentication and authorization features using GitHub or other OAuth providers.
